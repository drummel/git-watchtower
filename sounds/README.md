# Casino Mode Sound Effects

Casino mode uses system sounds by default. For custom sounds, add `.wav` files to this directory:

## Sound Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `win.wav` | Short victory sound (small/medium wins) |
| `jackpot.wav` | Exciting fanfare (big wins, jackpots) |
| `spin.wav` | Slot machine spinning sound |
| `loss.wav` | Sad trombone / failure sound |
